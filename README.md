# Foamgasm Bearing SCAR Threaded Alternatives


Threaded versions of Foamgasm's BCAR for Milsig M79 and JET Barrels

![image](/images/Threaded-BCARs.png)

These have been modified to suit various threaded barrels.

1) Milsig stock barrels with an M18x1.0 RH thread
2) Jet barrel with 0.625" UNF thread

Two versions are available, Standard and Deadspace

The deadspace version was created based on theory where having a full dart gap between the end of the barrel and the start of the bearing will avoid fishtailing - the dart will not begin to twist until it has fully left the barrel. Unsure if it works in practice.
