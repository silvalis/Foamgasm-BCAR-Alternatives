# Foamgasm Bearing SCAR Alternatives


Modified versions of Foamgasm's BCAR for Milsig M79

![image](/images/Milsig-M79-BCAR.png)

These have been modified to suit Milsig stock barrels with an M18x1.0 RH thread on the end.

Two versions are available, Standard and Deadspace

The deadspace version was created based on theory where having a full dart gap between the end of the barrel and the start of the bearing will avoid fishtailing - the dart will not begin to twist until it has fully left the barrel. Unsure if it works in practice.



All BCARs use:
